### 🚀 What I Do

I architect AI-powered automation systems that **reduce business workload**, eliminate repetitive tasks, and enable smarter decision-making using LLMs, voice interfaces, and agentic workflows.

---

### 🧠 Core Focus

- **LLM-Based Automations** for cognitive and multi-step workflows  
- **Agentic Systems** with LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph, and function-calling  
- **Voice AI Agents** powered by `Vapi.ai`, ElevenLabs, Whisper, and OpenAI  
- **NLP & Custom GPTs** for industry-specific reasoning and contextual understanding  
- **Business Workflow Automation** using `Make.com` and `n8n` for real-world tool integrations

> From automating support and sales to building 24/7 intelligent agents—I'm focused on creating systems that think, act, and adapt.

### 📌 Current Projects

- End-to-end automation systems triggered via **LLM logic + n8n**  
- **Voice AI Assistants** using Vapi.ai for sales, support, and tutoring agents  
- Custom GPTs deployed with workflows that integrate into existing tools (e.g. Notion, Slack, CRMs)  
- Dynamic pipelines that connect LangChain agents with **Make.com** scenarios for no-code extensibility

### 🧰 Also Skilled In

Though my core focus is AI automation, I also build:

- **Mobile Apps** using React Native (Expo SDK 51)  
- **Full-Stack Web Platforms** using Next.js, Tailwind, REST & GraphQL
