### 🚀 What I Do

I architect AI-powered automation systems that **reduce business workload**, eliminate repetitive tasks, and enable smarter decision-making using LLMs, no-code tools, and agentic workflows.

---

### 🧠 Core Focus

- **LLM-Based Automations** for cognitive and multi-step workflows  
- **Agentic Systems** with LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph, and function-calling  
- **NLP & Custom GPTs** for industry-specific use cases and contextual logic  
- **Voice AI Interfaces** (TTS/STT) with ElevenLabs, Whisper, and OpenAI  
- **Business Workflow Automation** using `Make.com` and `n8n` for real-world integrations

Whether it's automating sales follow-ups, support triaging, or internal task routing — I build systems that work autonomously.

### 📌 Current Projects

- Agentic systems that trigger Make.com or n8n flows via LLM decision logic  
- Custom GPTs + autonomous agents that handle support, lead gen, and CRM workflows  
- Modular automation blueprints for small teams scaling without hiring
