### 🚀 What I Do

I design and build advanced AI automation systems that reduce business workload, streamline decision-making, and unlock scalable operations using LLMs and agentic workflows.

My work focuses on:

- **LLM-based automations** that perform multi-step tasks with minimal human input  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding and generating human-like responses  
- **Autonomous Agents & RAG pipelines** using LangChain, CrewAI, and LangGraph  
- **Voice & Text Interfaces** using TTS/STT APIs like ElevenLabs, OpenAI Whisper  
- **AI Infrastructure** integrating memory, context, search, and APIs

### 🧠 Current Focus

- Architecting agent-based AI systems for real-time automation  
- Developing LLM tools that handle repetitive cognitive tasks in business workflows  
- Fine-tuning pipelines for task planning, chaining, and context-aware execution  
- Building reusable backend frameworks for client-facing AI services
